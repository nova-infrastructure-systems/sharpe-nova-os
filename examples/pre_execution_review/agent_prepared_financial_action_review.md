# Purpose

This example shows how Sharpe Nova OS can structure an agent-prepared financial action for review before local authority acts.

Nova does not approve, deny, block, execute, route, settle, trade, optimize, control wallets, control agents, move capital, or make the final decision.

Nova emits pre-action governance context — a structured review status and related concerns before any action happens.

The core sequence is:

```text
The agent prepares the action.
Nova structures the review context.
Local authority decides.
Nova does not execute.
```

---

# Scenario

An autonomous or semi-autonomous financial workflow agent prepares a proposed action for local authority review.

The proposed action involves initiating a material financial action between approved operational contexts.

Before the proposed action reaches local authority, several review conditions appear:

```text
route confirmation is incomplete
source evidence is weakening
context confidence is declining
the same path has been retried multiple times
review proximity is increasing
```

The question is not whether the action should proceed.

The question is whether local authority can see enough governed context before deciding.

# Thin Intent Packet

A thin intent packet might only show:

```yaml
intent:
  action_type: proposed_financial_action
  materiality: material
  source_context: approved_operational_source
  destination_context: approved_operational_destination
  stated_reason: operational_opportunity
  status: prepared_for_review
```

This packet is not false.

It is incomplete.

It does not show:

* incomplete confirmation
* weakening source evidence
* declining context confidence
* same-path retry pressure
* elevated path fragility
* proximity to local authority review

A local authority reviewer could see what the agent wants to do without seeing why the action requires constrained review.

---

# Nova-Conditioned Review Packet

A Nova-conditioned review packet adds pre-action context.

```yaml
nova_review:
  posture: Constrained Review
  posture_plain_language: structured_review_status_before_action
  review_context:
    route_confirmation: incomplete
    source_evidence: weakening
    context_confidence: declining
    retry_pattern: same_path_retry
    retry_density: elevated
    path_fragility: elevated
    authority_proximity: approaching_review
  local_authority_note:
    - Same-path retry occurred after incomplete confirmation.
    - Retry density increased inside a short review window.
    - Path fragility is elevated.
    - Source evidence is weakening.
    - Local authority should see retry pressure before deciding.
```

This packet does not decide the action.

It makes the action more reviewable before local authority acts.

---

# Local Authority Separation

Local authority may decide to:

* proceed
* pause
* escalate
* request more information
* reject the proposed action under its own policy

Nova does not make that decision.

Nova does not pause the action.

Nova does not approve or deny the action.

Nova provides governed pre-action context.

The decision remains local.

# What Nova Did

In this example, Nova did the following:

```text
Structured the agent-prepared action before local authority review.
Surfaced incomplete confirmation.
Surfaced weakening source evidence.
Surfaced declining context confidence.
Surfaced same-path retry pressure.
Emitted a Constrained Review posture.
Made the proposed action more reviewable before authority acted.
```

---

# What Nova Did Not Do

Nova did not:

```text
approve the action
deny the action
authorize the action
block the action
execute the action
route the action
settle the action
trade
optimize returns
allocate capital
control a wallet
control an agent
move live capital
make the final decision
```

This section is mandatory.

If a reader interprets Nova as controlling the action, the example has failed.

# Why This Matters

Agentic financial workflows can prepare actions faster than institutions can review the full decision context.

A thin intent packet may show what an agent intends to do, but not why the action deserves constrained review before authority acts.

Nova’s role is to condition the review environment before local authority decides.

This helps local authority see:

```text
what is being proposed
what evidence is weakening
what constraints are active
what retry behavior is present
what context changed
what should be reviewed before any action proceeds
```

The value is not prediction.

The value is not execution.

The value is not performance.

The value is governed pre-action reviewability.

# Not Claims

This example does not claim:

* market validation
* buyer demand
* production readiness
* benchmark performance
* financial performance improvement
* yield improvement
* loss prevention
* better returns
* execution safety
* approval automation
* routing capability
* settlement capability
* wallet control
* agent control
* trading capability
* allocation capability

The evidence classification is:

```text
external legibility evidence
```

not:

```text
market validation
```

# Reader Evidence Note

This example is derived from an internal proof workflow that passed two non-Nova reader comprehension tests.

Both readers understood that:

```text
The harness generated synthetic intent.
Nova emitted pre-action governance posture and review concerns.
Local authority simulation made the decision.
No live capital moved.
Nova did not approve, deny, block, execute, route, settle, or control anything.
The record is governance evidence, not financial performance evidence.
```

This reader evidence supports external legibility.

It does not support market validation, production readiness, benchmark claims, public GTM, or code implementation.

---

# Final Boundary Compression

The agent prepares the action.

Nova structures the review context.

Local authority decides.

Nova does not execute.
