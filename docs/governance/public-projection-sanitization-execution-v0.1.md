# Public Projection Sanitization Execution v0.1

**Status:** inventory complete; production source cutover and repository validation complete; stabilization and CCO completion review satisfied; removals blocked only pending explicit Architect deletion authority  
**Baseline repository:** `nova-infrastructure-systems/sharpe-nova-os`  
**Baseline branch:** `main`  
**Baseline SHA:** `eeba729534088bdec705e84219188bb5aaaa14eb`  
**Tracked paths inventoried:** 638

## Governing boundary

```text
Public = contract, doctrine, interoperability, and approved proof.
Private = production machinery, proprietary derivation, corporate state, and operating evidence.
Provider-only = secret values and live environment credentials.
```

This inventory protects future compounding implementation. It does not claim
that material already published in Git history has become confidential.

## Production continuity gate

Provider operating details are intentionally summarized here. Detailed provider
evidence belongs in the private operating-evidence surface; secret values remain
provider-only.

  removal_gate: BLOCKED_PENDING_EXPLICIT_ARCHITECT_DELETION_AUTHORITY
```

The rollback exercise established that a provider `Live` state and healthy
`/health` response do not by themselves prove authenticated continuity. The
recovery sequence must verify provider-held identity state and authenticated
behavior after rollback before service recovery can be declared.

The immediate production cutover proof establishes submitted evidence that the
active `nova-api` service now uses private `nova-core` as its implementation
source while preserving the tested Legacy external contract and the complete
three-identity production credential set. This is operator-observed evidence,
not independent provider verification.

The post-cutover repository validation is recorded in
[`docs/operations/post-cutover-repository-validation-2026-08-28.md`](../operations/post-cutover-repository-validation-2026-08-28.md).
It verifies the current public contract suite, current private repository suite,
the exact deployed private Legacy source CI result, and critical Legacy runtime
blob identity. Repository validation does not convert operator-observed provider
evidence into independent provider verification.

No runtime, deployment, payment, control, telemetry, or provider-topology file
may be removed from the public branch until stabilization, CCO completion
review, and explicit Architect authorization for deletion-bearing sanitization
are complete.

## Completion-state reconciliation — September 18, 2026

The private canonical repository now records the Legacy continuity workstream as
complete in `docs/operations/legacy-continuity-completion-receipt-2026-08-28.md`.
That receipt records both the stabilization observation and CCO completion review
as satisfied.

This narrows the remaining public-sanitization gate to one explicit authority
question:

```yaml
deletion_bearing_public_sanitization:
  stabilization_observation: verified_complete
  CCO_completion_review: satisfied
  explicit_Architect_deletion_authority: not_granted
  safe_to_execute_now: false
```

Repository cleanup that does not delete or remove current public paths may
continue. Moving or removing files from the current public tree remains
deletion-bearing sanitization and requires a separate explicit Architect
authorization.

## Exact classification rules

The rules below classify every tracked path at the baseline SHA. They are
evaluated from top to bottom; the first match wins. A rule is an inventory
classification, not deletion authority.

## Required unblocking evidence

Before a deletion-bearing sanitization commit:

1. connect the production provider to the private implementation source — **evidence submitted**;
2. verify the deployed private source alignment on the primary production service — **evidence submitted**;
3. verify health and the existing external containment contract after cutover — **evidence submitted**;
4. verify provider identity state, exact three-credential fingerprint parity, and three-of-three authenticated behavior after cutover — **evidence submitted**;
5. exercise rollback/recovery behavior on the bounded private continuity candidate — **evidence submitted**, with the material finding that provider-held credential state is not automatically preserved by rollback;
6. preserve provider evidence separately from public repository configuration — **private evidence receipts updated; independent verification remains outstanding**;
7. complete a stabilization observation with the primary service left unchanged unless an actual regression requires intervention — **verified complete in the private Legacy continuity completion receipt**;
8. re-run the full public contract validation suite after cutover — **repository-verified complete**;
9. re-run the private implementation validation suite after cutover — **repository-verified complete**;
10. reconcile the transition artifacts to the post-cutover state and complete CCO review — **verified complete in the private Legacy continuity completion receipt**;
11. obtain explicit Architect authority before any deletion-bearing public sanitization — **not yet granted; this remains the sole removal gate**.

Evidence submission is not independent verification. Repository validation does
not authorize payment or settlement change, retail RP8B completion,
institutional Gate 5, chronology, institutional Reflex Memory mutation,
accepted-state mutation, or public-runtime removal.
