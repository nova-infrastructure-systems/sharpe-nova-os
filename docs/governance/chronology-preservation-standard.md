# Chronology Preservation Standard

## Status

Governance standard  
Boundary-preserving chronology discipline  
Non-authority documentation layer

## Purpose

Sharpe Nova OS preserves chronology to improve future review context.

Chronology records decision-state lineage: what was known, what changed, what was corrected, what was accepted, what was paused, and what boundary was active at the time.

Chronology is part of Nova's review-context discipline.

It is not execution authority.

---

## Canonical Boundary

Agent prepares action.  
Nova structures review context.  
Local authority decides.  
Nova does not execute.

Chronology must preserve this boundary.

Chronology must never imply that Nova approves, denies, authorizes, blocks, routes, settles, executes, processes payments, moves capital, supervises agents, performs compliance review, performs audit reporting, or replaces local authority.

---

## What Chronology Is

Chronology is preserved decision-state lineage.

It may include:

- material repo events
- proof-chain milestones
- governance corrections
- boundary clarifications
- source limitations
- continuity gaps
- CCO-reconciled events
- manual acceptance events
- archive movements
- public framing changes
- controlled discoverability updates

Chronology exists to help future reviewers understand the state of the system at the time a decision, correction, or proof movement occurred.

---

## What Chronology Is Not

Chronology is not:

- performance history
- marketing sequence
- adoption evidence
- buyer validation
- market validation
- production-readiness evidence
- external dependency proof
- automatic memory mutation
- automatic acceptance
- authority over execution
- evidence that Nova is required infrastructure today

Chronology may become strategically valuable over time if users rely on Nova's continuity record, but external dependency is not assumed.

---

## Source Classification

Chronology entries must distinguish the source status of each event.

Use the following classifications:

```yaml
source_confirmed_event:
  meaning: directly observed in an available source during the run

architect_provided_event:
  meaning: provided by the Architect but not independently surfaced by connector

cco_reconciled_event:
  meaning: accepted by Jarvis-Nova CCO after reviewing a source conflict or source limitation

source_unavailable:
  meaning: cannot be confirmed during the run

stale_connector_artifact:
  meaning: connector-visible state appears behind known Architect-provided or CCO-resolved state
```

Do not let a stale connector artifact overwrite a CCO-reconciled event.

Do not treat Architect-provided evidence as connector-confirmed unless it is independently visible.

---

## Continuity Gaps

Continuity gaps must be logged explicitly.

A continuity gap is any meaningful pause, deactivation window, missing source interval, or workspace discontinuity that could later create ambiguity.

Continuity gaps are not automatically failures.

They become risks when they are not recorded.

Example classification:

```yaml
event_type: continuity_gap
classification: intentional_deactivation_and_revision_window
meaning: public posting or operating activity paused while OS materials were revised
risk: external observers may see silence without understanding internal system revision
cco_interpretation: not drift if properly logged
chronology_requirement: preserve as continuity event, not performance failure
```

---

## Manual Acceptance Before Chronology Movement

Where applicable, chronology movement should preserve manual acceptance before lifecycle movement.

A review artifact, proof packet, or operating note should not automatically become chronology.

Chronology should distinguish:

- generated artifact
- reviewed artifact
- accepted artifact
- archived artifact
- public artifact

This prevents automatic memory mutation and protects the local authority boundary.

---

## Minimum Entry Requirements

Each material chronology entry should include:

```yaml
date:
event_type:
source_classification:
summary:
layer_affected:
boundary_state:
evidence_anchor:
source_limitations:
cco_interpretation:
decision_impact:
chronology_action:
```

---

## Layer Classification

Chronology entries should identify the layer affected.

Allowed layer examples:

- repo
- governance
- proof_workflow
- chronology
- archive
- content_engine
- market_signal
- external_grant
- public_framing
- api_context
- controlled_discoverability
- reflex_memory

---

## Boundary Language Requirement

Every chronology entry touching execution-adjacent domains must preserve the canonical boundary.

Use:

```text
Nova structures review context before local authority acts.
```

Do not use:

```text
Claims that assign approval authority to Nova.
Claims that assign denial authority to Nova.
Claims that assign authorization authority to Nova.
Claims that assign blocking authority to Nova.
Claims that assign permission authority to Nova.
Claims that assign execution authority to Nova.
Claims that assign routing authority to Nova.
Claims that assign settlement authority to Nova.
Claims that assign agent-control authority to Nova.
```

---

## Stale Connector Handling

If a connector returns stale repo or document state, classify the issue explicitly.

Example:

```yaml
source_classification: stale_connector_artifact
connector_visible_state: old_commit_or_old_file_state
architect_provided_state: newer_commit_or_corrected_file_state
cco_interpretation: source freshness limitation, not doctrine blocker
chronology_action: preserve both states with reconciliation note
```

This protects chronology from false conflict.

---

## Chronology Preservation Rule

The correct chronology discipline is:

```text
Preserve events.
Label sources.
Log gaps.
Separate doctrine from interpretation.
Protect the boundary.
```

Chronology should make Nova easier to review later without making Nova appear broader, more operational, or more authoritative than it is.

---

## Chronology Operating Cadence

Chronology preservation requires a lightweight cadence.

The standard should not become passive documentation. It should guide how material system events are reviewed, reconciled, and preserved over time.

### Daily Review

Daily review should record material system events when they occur.

Examples include:

- repo changes
- proof-chain movements
- governance corrections
- CCO reconciliations
- content engine operating-rule changes
- market-signal events with Nova relevance
- grant-facing posture changes
- public framing changes
- source conflicts
- stale connector artifacts
- continuity gaps

Daily review should also mark unavailable sources explicitly.

Use:

```yaml
daily_chronology_review:
  record_material_events: true
  mark_source_unavailable: true
  preserve_source_limitations: true
  avoid_non_material_noise: true
```

### Weekly Reconciliation

Weekly reconciliation should review unresolved source conflicts and incomplete events.

Examples include:

- stale connector artifacts
- Architect-provided events not independently surfaced by connector
- CCO-reconciled events not yet reflected in chronology
- local repo / public repo divergence
- source-incomplete Daily Coherence Agent runs
- proof artifacts not yet preserved
- continuity gaps not yet logged
- content engine updates not yet reflected in chronology

Use:

```yaml
weekly_chronology_reconciliation:
  reconcile_stale_connector_artifacts: true
  check_architect_provided_events: true
  review_unarchived_cco_reconciliations: true
  identify_unresolved_continuity_gaps: true
  preserve_boundary_state: true
```

### Monthly Signal-Quality Review

Monthly review should evaluate whether chronology remains useful for future review context.

It should check whether chronology is becoming too thin, too noisy, or too authority-adjacent.

Use:

```yaml
monthly_chronology_signal_quality_review:
  check_review_context_value: true
  remove_or_quarantine_duplicate_noise: true
  check_for_authority_language: true
  check_for_performance_history_language: true
  check_for_adoption_or_market_validation_drift: true
  preserve_high_signal_continuity: true
```

The monthly review should not convert chronology into marketing history.

It should preserve chronology as decision-state lineage.

---

## Chronology Entry Filter

Chronology should not absorb everything.

Chronology should preserve material decision-state events, not every conversation, idea, draft, or repeated observation.

The goal is high-signal continuity.

Use the following filter when deciding whether an event belongs in chronology.

```yaml
chronology_entry_filter:
  include_if:
    - changes_repo_state
    - changes_doctrine_or_boundary_interpretation
    - records_proof_chain_movement
    - records_cco_reconciliation
    - records_source_conflict
    - records_stale_connector_artifact
    - records_continuity_gap
    - affects_public_framing
    - affects_external_grant_or_institutional_review_posture
    - affects_content_engine_operating_rules
    - affects_archive_state
    - affects_reflex_memory_governance
    - affects_controlled_discoverability
  exclude_if:
    - ordinary_brainstorming
    - unused_draft
    - unapproved_speculation
    - repeated_observation_with_no_new_state
    - content_idea_not_tied_to_evidence
    - market_signal_without_nova_relevance
    - temporary_language_experiment
    - duplicate_note_without_decision_impact
```

### Include Examples

Chronology should include:

- a new governance standard added to the repo
- a CCO correction to boundary language
- a proof-chain milestone
- a stale connector artifact that creates source conflict
- an Architect-provided commit not visible to connector
- a content engine rule that changes how public content is generated
- a continuity gap such as an intentional pause or deactivation window
- a public framing change that affects how Nova is understood

### Exclude Examples

Chronology should usually exclude:

- one-off brainstorms
- unapproved post drafts
- repeated observations with no new state
- unsupported market speculation
- internal phrasing experiments
- content ideas not connected to evidence
- notes that do not affect repo, governance, proof, archive, content, market interpretation, or boundary state

If uncertain, mark the item as a candidate chronology event rather than immediately accepting it.

```yaml
candidate_chronology_event:
  status: pending_review
  reason_for_candidate_status:
  source_limitations:
  cco_review_needed:
```

---

## Chronology Signal Quality Rule

Chronology should be complete enough to reconstruct decision context, but selective enough to remain reviewable.

Too little chronology weakens continuity.

Too much chronology weakens signal.

The correct balance is:

```text
Complete enough to reconstruct context.
Selective enough to preserve signal.
```

Chronology should not become an archive landfill.

It should preserve the material decision-state lineage needed for future review.

Use this rule:

```yaml
chronology_signal_quality:
  preserve_material_decision_state: true
  avoid_archive_landfill: true
  avoid_marketing_sequence: true
  avoid_performance_history: true
  avoid_authority_implication: true
  prioritize_review_context: true
```

The purpose of chronology is not to remember everything.

The purpose is to preserve the context that makes future review possible.

---

## Model-Originated Result and Reliance Lineage

Later validation, amendment, or correction must not rewrite the review state
that authority actually saw.

For a material claim or result, governed chronology should be able to preserve
these relationships when a separately governed chronology event exists:

```yaml
chronology_relationships:
  - original_result_version
  - validation_artifact_available_at_review
  - assumptions_visible_at_review
  - human_contextualization_available_at_review
  - authority_reviewed_version
  - authority_treatment
  - later_validation
  - later_correction
  - amendment
  - supersession
```

The distinction is:

```text
Audit log:
Records that artifacts changed.

Governed chronology:
Preserves which result version,
validation state,
assumptions,
and limitations authority actually reviewed.
```

Amendment, correction, and supersession are linked, append-only relationships.
They do not silently replace the historical result or validation state.
Changing a model provider also does not erase the institution's prior reliance
history.

This specification refinement creates no chronology event. Any future event
requires the existing review, acceptance, source-classification, and movement
discipline.

---

## Final Principle

Chronology is not yet Nova's moat.

Chronology is the condition under which a moat could form if continuity becomes relied upon.

Until then, chronology should be treated as institutional review-context discipline.

The operating rule is:

```text
Preserve events.
Label sources.
Log gaps.
Separate doctrine from interpretation.
Protect the boundary.
Maintain signal quality.
```

Chronology should be complete enough to reconstruct decision context, but selective enough to remain reviewable.
